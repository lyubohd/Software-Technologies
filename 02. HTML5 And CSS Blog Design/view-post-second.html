                        <h2>Knicks Shoot and Defend Poorly Against a Short-Handed Toronto</h2>
                    </header>

                    <p>TORONTO — The Knicks let a poor shooting performance contribute to a dismal defensive effort. It
                        all added up to their eighth consecutive loss to the Toronto Raptors. Toronto’s Kyle Lowry
                        matched his season high with 22 points and added 10 assists, and DeMar
                        DeRozan also scored 22 as the short-handed Raptors beat the Knicks, 107-84, on Friday night.
                        The Knicks’ Kristaps Porzingis shot 3 for 13 while Tim Hardaway Jr. finished 5 for 11. The team
                        shot 30 for 92 over all, for its lowest field goal percentage of the season.
                        “It was us missing a lot of good shots,” Porzingis said. “Just not in our rhythm. As the game
                        went on, we still were struggling finding our rhythm and finding the best positions to attack
                        from. It was just a rough night for us.”
                        Hardaway and Porzingis each scored 13 points, and Enes Kanter had 12 for the Knicks, who fell
                        behind by double-digits in a poor-shooting first half and couldn’t recover.</p>
