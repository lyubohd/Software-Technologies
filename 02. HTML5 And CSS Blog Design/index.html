                        <h2>Celtics Own Warriors in the Third Quarter of Big Victory</h2>
                    </header>

                    <p>Over the last four seasons, the Golden State Warriors have owned the third quarter. Any game, no
                        matter what the score at halftime, has seemed to tilt their way as soon as the second half
                        begins. The Boston Celtics turned that notion on its head Thursday night, completely taking over
                        in the third against the Warriors. And after they made the defending champions sweat, they
                        outfought them in the fourth quarter for a shocking 92-88 victory.
                        It was a strong enough performance by the Celtics that Stephen Curry was asked after the game
                        about potentially returning to Boston for the N.B.A. Finals. Curry noted that the Celtics would
                        have to get past Cleveland first but was far from dismissive.
                        “I hear the weather is great here in June,” he said, drawing a big laugh from the assembled
                        crowd of reporters.
                        It was a game of highs and lows for Boston. Jaylen Brown had multiple highlight-reel dunks, Al
                        Horford was quietly excellent, and the team reeled off an outrageous 19-0 run in the third
                        quarter. But for much of the night they were struggling to overcome a terrible start from both
                        Kyrie Irving and Jayson Tatum. In the end, the early struggles by those two starters proved
                        inconsequential, as Boston’s winning streak reached 14 games thanks in part to Irving and Tatum
                        being right in the middle of the action in the game’s closing moments.</p>

                        <h2>Knicks Shoot and Defend Poorly Against a Short-Handed Toronto</h2>
                    </header>

                    <p>TORONTO — The Knicks let a poor shooting performance contribute to a dismal defensive effort. It
                        all added up to their eighth consecutive loss to the Toronto Raptors. Toronto’s Kyle Lowry
                        matched his season high with 22 points and added 10 assists, and DeMar
                        DeRozan also scored 22 as the short-handed Raptors beat the Knicks, 107-84, on Friday night.
                        The Knicks’ Kristaps Porzingis shot 3 for 13 while Tim Hardaway Jr. finished 5 for 11. The team
                        shot 30 for 92 over all, for its lowest field goal percentage of the season.
                        “It was us missing a lot of good shots,” Porzingis said. “Just not in our rhythm. As the game
                        went on, we still were struggling finding our rhythm and finding the best positions to attack
                        from. It was just a rough night for us.”
                        Hardaway and Porzingis each scored 13 points, and Enes Kanter had 12 for the Knicks, who fell
                        behind by double-digits in a poor-shooting first half and couldn’t recover.</p>
